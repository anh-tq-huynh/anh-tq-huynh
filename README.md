## Hi there 👋
Professionalism - Trustworthiness - Growth Orientation, they are the key values that I would do my best to uphold and polish to grow in my IT career.

My name is Anh. I am currently a second-year Information Technology student at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences (UAS) who is diligently striving to learn and develop my career in the IT field. With over three years of experience working in communication as a Marketing Technician, I have acquired substantial experience in communication and possess a deeper understanding of how to articulate technical terminology in a manner comprehensible to all individuals.
